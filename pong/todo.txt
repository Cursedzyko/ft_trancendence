2)Need to create a Tournament

Tournament Setup:

DONE  Ask the user how many players will participate in the tournament.
DONE  Once the number of players is submitted, dynamically generate input fields where each player can enter their alias or display name.


Player Registration:

Collect the aliases of all the players and store them in a list.
Once registration is complete, reset any previous tournament data.

Matchmaking System:

Based on the list of registered players, create a match order.
you could implement an elimination bracket system.
The matchmaking system will determine the next set of players and display who is currently playing and who will play next.

Notification System:

Announce the next match and notify the players who will be participating in the upcoming game.

Game Flow:

Manage the flow of the tournament by tracking which match is currently being played and updating the list of completed matches.
The system should automatically advance to the next match after the current one finishes.
